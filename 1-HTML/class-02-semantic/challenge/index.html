                    I don't know but today seems kinda odd <br>
                    No barkin' from the dog, no smog <br>
                    And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog <br>
                    I got my grub on, but didn't pig out <br>
                    Finally, got a call from a girl I wanna dig out <Br>
                    Hooked it up fo' later as I hit the do' <br>
                    Thinkin', "Will I live another 24'?" <br>

               <p>I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop top <br>
                And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop <br>
                Had to stop, at a red light <br>
                Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight <br>

                <p>And everything is alright <br>
                    I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night <br>
                    Called up the homies, and I'm askin' y'all <br>
                    Which park, are y'all playin' basketball? <br>
                    Get me on the court and I'm trouble <br>
                    Last week fucked around and got a triple-double <br>
                    Freakin' niggas every way like MJ <br>
                    I can't believe, today was a good day, shit! <br>

                <p>Drove to the pad and hit the showers <br>
                    Didn't even get no static from them cowards <br>
                    'Cause just yesterday, them fools tried to blast me <br>
                    Saw the police, and they rolled right past me <br>
                    No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction <br>
                    As I ran the intersection <br>
                    Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps <br>
                    What's the haps on the craps?

                <p>Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em! <br>
                    Roll 'em in a circle of niggas, and watch me break 'em <br>
                    Wit' the seven, 7-11, 7-11 <br>
                    Seven, even back do' Lil Joe <br>
                    I picked up the cash flow <br>
                    Then we played bones, and I'm yellin' "Domino!" <br>
                    Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA <br>
                    Today was a good day, shit!

              <p>Left my nigga's house paid <br>
                Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade <br>
                It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic <br>
                The Lakers beat the Supersonics <br>
                I felt on her big fat fanny <br>
                Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani <br>
                And my dick runs deep, so deep, so deep <br>
                Put her ass to sleep
            </p>

               <p>Woke her up around one <br>
                She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun <br>
                Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin' <br>
                Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion <br>
                I was glad everything had worked out <br>
                Dropped her ass off, and then chirped out

                <h2>Estrofe 8</h2>
                <p>Today was like one of those fly dreams <br>
                    Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams <br>
                    No helicopter lookin' for a murder <br>
                    Two in the mornin', got the Fatburger <br>
                    Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp <br>
                    And it read, "Ice Cube's a Pimp!" (yeah) <br>
                    Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up <br>
                    Halfway home, and my pager's still blowin' up <br>
                    Today, I didn't even have to use my AK <br>
                    I gotta say it was a good day, shit! <br>
                    Hey, wait, wait a minute! <br>
                    Pooh, stop this shit! <br>
                    What the fuck am I thinkin' about?
